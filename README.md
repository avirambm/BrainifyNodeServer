BrainifyNodeServer
==================

This project holds the node.js server of Brainify.

Brainify categorizes songs according to their mental influence on people, using a brain wave monitor device. 
While you listen to a song, we recognize its effect on your brain - how focused, happy or calm you are. 
Then, using a Spotify application, we suggest you songs according to the mood you want to get into, and even allow you to take full control of the music player and the volume level using facial expressions and head movements!
